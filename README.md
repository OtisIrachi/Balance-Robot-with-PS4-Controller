# Balance-Robot-with-PS4-Controller
Balance Robot using ESP32, and PS4 Bluetooth Game Controller.

Built with ESP32 D1 Mini board, MPU6050 Axis Gyroscope, (2) A4988 Stepper Drivers, and MAX7219 LED MAtrix Modules.
Servo Arm code is included, but I did not use one for this project.

After holding still B-Robot to initialize the MPU6050 unit,  you may connect the PS4 Controller by holding 
"Share" and "Home buttons simultaneously until LED rapid flashes.  Then the Bluetooth will connect with solid
LED.
Control the B-Robot with Right Joystick.
